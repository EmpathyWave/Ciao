        Ciao! Did you need anything from me or my cafe?
        ->DONE
    =DanniRiccobono_
        Oh, you are Lucca's neice, right? The Riccobono name is well known here.
        ->DONE
    =DanniRiccobono0GiovanniRiccobono_
        I haven't ever met Giovanni but I know about the bakery, Giovanni was sort of a celebrity. I didn't know he had a granddaughter.
        ->DONE
    =DanniRiccobono0LuccaRomana_
        I don't know where your uncle is right now, but I would assume maybe at the bakery. I hope he is doing alright.
        ->DONE
    =DanniRiccobono0PiccolaPanetteria_
        I don't know what you know about the bakery, but if Lucca is your uncle you should ask him what happened.
        ->DONE
    =DanniRiccobono0TheBees_
        They aren't too friendly of punks, they probably wont't want to talk to you.
        ->DONE
    =GiovanniRiccobono_
        I have never met him, but I know the town misses him. From all the stories it seems like he did the best he could, I try not to get wrapped up small town drama.
        ->DONE
    =GiovanniRiccobono0LuccaRomana_
        I uhh, I don't know much about that whole situation. Ask around I am sure other people know more than I do.
        ->DONE
    =GiovanniRiccobono0PiccolaPanetteria_
        Yeah, that's a lot to unpack. I would assume he misses the bakery, but I don't know him, you would know more than I do.
        ->DONE
    =GiovanniRiccobono0TheBees_
        Hahaha I don't think they know each other...
        ->DONE
    =LuccaRomana_
        Yeah he and I made a deal that I would sell his pasteries at my cafe, but I don't know what's happening now.
        ->DONE
    =LuccaRomana0PiccolaPanetteria_
        Oh I have heard something is happening with him and the bakery, it seems he is getting too old to run it by himself.
        ->DONE
    =LuccaRomana0TheBees_
        I don't think those punks like anyone over the age of 16.
        ->DONE
    =PiccolaPanetteria_
        Oh if you are looking for the bakery you should go to the piazza, you have a map, right? It's just a bit futher into town.
        ->DONE
    =PiccolaPanetteria0TheBees_
        I have seen those punks loiter everywhere but they know not to mess with the bakery or Lucca il Lupo.
        ->DONE
    =TheBees_
        Yeah those kids are just a bunch of punks. They are just at that age where they just are annoying.

        ->DONE
    =GiovanniRiccobono_
        Don't know 'em. -Actually I heard he left town for some girl, I would never leave my brothers behind like that.
        ->DONE
    =GiovanniRiccobono0LuccaRomana_
        Oh yeah everyone knows about their beef. But we don't care, that's not what we do.
        ->DONE
    =GiovanniRiccobono0PiccolaPanetteria_

        ->DONE

        ->DONE
    =LuccaRomana0TheBees_
        He is a good one, if anyone messes with him they mess with us. -Yeah they would feel our stingers! -My dad took my knife away though... -Oh...
        ->DONE
    =PiccolaPanetteria_
        Yeah the bakery is just in town if you are looking for it, that place is the best.
        ->DONE
    =PiccolaPanetteria0TheBees_
        We love that place right, boys? -Right! -Yeah!
        ->DONE
    =TheBees_
        That's us, don't forget that we run this town.
